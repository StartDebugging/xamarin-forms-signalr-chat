# Sample Xamarin Forms chat app using SignalR

The clients are configured with an Azure-deployed version of the SignalR backend so that you can run them anywhere as soon as you've cloned the repository without any additional configuration. Just click Connect and type-away.

If you would like to run your own backend, you can either deploy or run locally the `SignalRChat.Web` project and update `ChatHubUrl` in `appsettings.json` accordingly.
