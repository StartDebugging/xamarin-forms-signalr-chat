# Sample Xamarin Forms chat app using SignalR

The clients are configured with an Azure-deployed version of the SignalR backend so that you can run them anywhere as soon as you've cloned the repository without any additional configuration. 

However, if you would like to run your own backend, you can either deploy or run locally the `SignalRChat.Web` project and update the `SIGNALR_CHAT_SERVER_URL` in `MainPage.cs` accordingly.
